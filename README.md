I create this program because in university teacher doesn't calculate mean to us. <br>
second reason is I want to practice read and write file in advance way

**How this program run**
1) Run program one time, that program will create new folder call *inputFolder* <br>
2) Create some text file that have score inside *line-by-line* <br>
3) Run this program again and enter file name that you want to calculate <br>
    - you can enter more than 1 name separate by *1 space-bar* <br>
4) Program will ask you that you want to calculate again or not <br>
5) If program finish, it wil create new folder call *outputFolder* and put output file in there <br>
